 <h3> About Time </h3>
 <p>Time itself doesn't exist, it's merely an objective perspective. 
    Even if we had the superpower to go back in time, 
    we would still have regrets whatsover. 
    Now is all we have, so appreciate and cherish it like it's our last day. </p>
 <h3> The Old Fox </h3>
 <p> I really enjoyed how it represented the complicity of human nature, 
    and how individuals have to make a decision about what kind of person they want to become that aligns with their value principles. </p>
 <h3> Groundhog Day </h3>
 <p> If we can't change what happens to us, why don't we make something extraordinary out of repeated daily hasels? </p>
